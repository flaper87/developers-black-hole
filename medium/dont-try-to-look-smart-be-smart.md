This is a transcript of the keynote I gave at Pycon South Africa in 2017. It’s not a 1 to 1 transcript as the keynote was 1 hour long. 

I cut off some jokes, rephrased some of the points I made, and I also expanded a bit on others.

I’ll likely be editing this post as feedback comes in but I don’t anticipate any major change. :)
Hope you’ll enjoy this, admittedly long, read.

Imagine
==

Imagine  —  I’m not gonna go Deepak Chopra on you — for a second what would happen if you had the chance to start your career all over again. if you had a chance to you do all the things that you’ve done and imagine what you would change. 

Specifically, I want you to imagine that you don’t have all the time that you’ve had so far, you have way less time than you’ve had so far. Imagine what you would do and what you would change. I’ll give you just like a couple of seconds to go through that.

This topic is a bit hard for me as it covers some of the things I’ve gone through in my career that made me feel like an idiot when they happened. With time, I’ve realized that these are the things that have taken me where I’m at and I hope they will be useful to you as they were for me. I don’t intend to look smart but rather be honest, as honest as I can be about my past so that you can, perhaps, start ahead.

I owe a lot to the Internet
==

I owe a lot to the Internet and I mean A LOT! I really learned how to program on the Internet. The internet is where I became an engineer. The key was figuring out how to google stuff. As soon as I learned that, I felt powerful and I felt I was ready to conquer the world. That's kinda all it takes, am I right?

I joined IRC channels, I read blogs, I learned from open source. I figured out where people would upload their code and that's what I used as a source of enlightenment - how little I knew. I also found different communities that I wanted to participate in and I learned how to speak up.

I learned good things and bad things that I then had to unlearn but, the key of all this is that I understood the mechanism by which I could start making my way "up".

Even my hate for it
==

Unfortunately, not everything I owe to the internet is good. I also owe the internet my hate for it. Yes, I hate the internet. I hate it because it is addictive. I hate how much it consumes my friends and how hard it is sometimes for me to spend time with them. I hate the damage it has caused our society and the fact it shows me things that, sometimes, I would rather not know.

It's not Internet's fault
==

Thing is, we all know it is not the Internet's fault. It is our fault. We are humans and we make our own choices. It is our choice to let the internet "do bad things" for us as well as it is our choice to post the things we post and to read the things we read on it.

I'm a self-taught **engineer* (not a snowflake, really)
==

I'm a self-taught engineer. I'm not a special snowflake, really. There are **MANY** self-taught engineers around the world. However, when I started coding, I thought I had figured it all out, I was just googling the shit out of the internet while other people were going to college wasting their money and time - if you did, bear with me, you will laugh at me in a bit.

I felt special when I started, I felt smart and I felt I had figured it all out. I knew how to google so, jackpot?

I was very self-confident (*cough* arrogant *cough*) and I kept this fake smart attitude for a while until I interviewed with a big company, the very same company that had helped me become a developer, Google. Ha, I bet you saw this coming :)

How I got the interview is a fun story that I'll keep for later because this part is "humiliating" enough. 

Anyway, I interviewed with Google, many years ago. They rejected me and here's the "humiliating" part of my interview. I actually failed. It's not like I did well and they rejected me. I... fucking... failed. If you ask me, I'm actually happy things went the way they did but, read along, the funniest part has yet to come.

I failed the very first interview with them, on the very first question. If you think the question was about file permissions, you are wrong. It also had nothing to do with Linux, or python, or other stuff that I actually knew. The interviewer asked me what Big O notation is. Yep, Big O, I had no fucking idea what Big O is. You know why? BECAUSE THEY FREAKING TEACH YOU IN COLLEGE.

In full Flavio mode, I went off and googled it during my interview with Google but, Big O ain't something you digest in 2 mins, during a phone interview, with someone crunching Cheetos on the other side.

If you don't know what Big O is, it's ok. There's no reason why you should feel humiliated. The reason I felt that way is because my arrogance blinded me and that was the first time I realized that the attitude that had taken me there was not going to take me anywhere else and I had realized it in the worst way possible. 

Note: if you are a self-taught engineer, fear not. There's nothing bad about it. But, you gotta keep in mind that there's a bunch of basic theoretical knowledge that you may not know. I don't think you should go off and learn it now but get ready because you'll realize you don't know it the moment you'll need it.

Self-taught **professional**
==

As I progressed in my career, I realized that calling myself an engineer didn't have the same feeling. Let alone going around saying I didn't go to college. Trust me, there's nothing wrong with this but, I learned that what was really important to me was being a self-taught professional. Cheesy, ain't it?

What does that even mean?

With time, I learned how to interact with humans on the internet. I learned how to interact with my colleagues. I learned that knowing how to interact with other humans is probably the hardest skill you can ever strive to have and I'm far from mastering it. The point is, engineering is what I do for a living but being a professional, a good colleague and a good community member is what allows me to do engineering in a way that is productive not only for me but for others around me as well.

One of the first things I did was figuring out how I like to learn. By knowing how I like to learn I was able to put myself in the right position to do so. I was able to get myself out of my comfort zone.

Turns out, I like learning the hard way. I did Karate for 11(ish) years and believe me when I say that I learned how to defend myself after being beaten up a few times. Whether this is the least painful or more effective way to learn is not under discussion. We all learn in different ways and I like hitting the wall a few times before taking it down. 

I've learned from all the good and bad things in my career. Learning from the good things is probably easier. They provide good experiences and, most of the time, evident lessons. Learning how to learn from the "bad" things was a bit more difficult. It took me some time to understand that it is easier to find the lesson in one of the so-called "bad" experiences if I take a step back and look at it without being emotionally attached. To be honest, I still fail at this many times.

Internet is a black-hole for time
==

Well, as soon as I started using the Internet I realized that it's a black hole for time, which is probably not a secret for you if you are in any of the social media out there. Thing is, I've spent a lot of time on it and while I don't think that's a bad thing, I do believe we ought to be really careful. We should always evaluate how much value we put on the internet and our time.


Time's your most valuable currency
==

What the previous point actually taught is that time is my most valuable currency. The reason I believe Time is the most valuable currency we have is that time's value is the same for everyone. It's not like other currencies that you can use one to buy more of the other and, depending on their value, make more money. Time is the same for everyone, it passes for everyone. What changes is how much value *we* put on it. We might value time differently depending on our perspective and taste but it's the same for everyone.

The things we spend our time on are the ones that are, hopefully, going to teach us something and we have to strive for making the right call when it comes to investing our time. Every time we put time on something we are actually investing something of value.

As a side note, I don't often get mad, really. I'm happy most of the time. But, I get extremely mad when people waste my time.

The critical point here is that you are **never** going to get back the time that has passed.

One other thing that helped me understand this was going to too many conferences. I love conferences and I LOVE traveling but not every conference is worth my time. I don't mean this in an arrogant way but rather a very humble one if that's possible. If I feel my attendance to a specific conference is not going to provide any value to the conference or myself, I would rather dedicate that time to something else that will produce better results not only for me but for others too.

Can't have an impact if you don't care enough
==

Being so critical and analytical on how I spend my time taught me that you can't have an impact on things if you don't really care about things you are spending your time on.

Here's the thing, I'm a millennial, I was born in the 80s. Being a millennial makes me want to have an impact on everything I'm involved in and if I don't have "an impact" I quickly become demotivated. 6 months in a job and haven't had an impact? BOOM, demotivated. Dunno, we, millennials, are kinda boring sometimes.

Since having an impact on things is important for me, I had to learn that the things I spend my time on are the ones that I actually care about because I can't have an impact on something that I don't care about.

This is the point in my life when I started coding like crazy. I would do anything. Php, Java, C#, Perl... ok, maybe not Perl. I would do anything, I wanted to have an impact on open source projects especially because I learned a lot from open source projects (thank you all for your open source contributions). As I started doing this more and more, I also started analyzing what I was really after and I soon realized that impact was not the main motivation behind my contributions anymore. I just wanted people to know me. I wanted people to know I was there, I want everyone to know I was coding. I wanted people to know provide rewards to me and tell me how good the work I was doing was.

Overwhelm can lead to demotivation
==

I kept going down that road and I soon felt overwhelmed by all the things I had signed up for. It was just too much for me. That taught me that having too many options and being open to many things and being able to jump on some many projects can be demotivating. 

Many people come to me to tell me it's cool that I work for a company where I get to choose, to some extent, what open source projects I want to contribute to. Unfortunately, this can be extremely overwhelming and demotivating if you are not careful. If you can't figure out what to do, if you don't have a good formula, you will end up signing up for too many things or simply not knowing what to sign up for. Both paths are demotivating and stressful. Overcommitting, however, is probably the worst of the negative outcomes because most of the time it will drive you to under-deliver and that's freaking awful. It's awful because under-delivering is extremely frustrating and demotivating.

The overwhelm when you log in on the internet for the first time and you see how big it is and all the things you can do in it can be extremely demotivating. You may feel lost and think that in order to be successful you have to have an impact on many things.

Don't work for fame
==

The above taught me that I shouldn't be working for fame. Now, I didn't come up with this "tip", you can actually google it. But, it took me some time to digest it, to actually understand it. And I don't mean this in the way that "you shouldn't seek fame. If you work on the right project you will be famous", NO! I actually mean that seeking any kind of fame will guide you down the wrong path because you will likely end up working on things you don't really care about.

You have to work on the things you actually care about. It doesn't matter if you end up being super famous with a shit-ton of followers on twitter or not. The important thing is that you have to work on the things you really care about. If you don't care enough about something, step away. If you don't step away you are not only going to waste your time but also other people's time because you'll likely not going to put enough attention on the things you are doing. Furthermore, you're likely not going to grow throughout this process.

So, if you are working on a library that you think is useful and you are not being super rewarded for working on that library that doesn't mean you have to stop. If you think it is worth it, it is worth your time and it is useful then keep doing it. Don't wait for people to just come and tell you how awesome your library is. It feels great when they do that but that shouldn't be your goal.

Dopamine feels good but, it can be dangerous
==

All these experiences taught me how awesome Dopamine is. I love it!

Dopamine is a neurotransmitter. It controls the rewards and pleasure. I'm not a psychologist (in case you didn't know that already) but I sure know when I get a dopamine hit. A dopamine hit is that thing your body releases that make you feel great and awesome when things like somebody replying to your tweet, somebody following you on twitter, somebody telling you how great the job you did is, happen. When you reach your goals, when you have performance checks and you get bonuses for that, there's a dopamine hit. That's great but there's a problem with it, it's highly addictive.

Dopamine is so addictive that it can make you do things for the wrong reason. For example, going to conferences just so that people will know you and you get new followers. There's a bunch of dopamine you will get out of this but, you won't be attending the conference for the right reason.

When you are addicted to dopamine, you are obsessed with hitting the numbers. You suddenly become focused on things that will generate more dopamine hits (getting more followers, getting more forks on GitHub, etc) and you will lose track of how you are investing your time and whether what you are doing is worth it or not.

Let me put it in a different way: If you worry more about the number of people following you on twitter than the people you follow on Twitter, then you are doing it wrong. The people you follow on twitter are not the ones that you will read every day, that will likely teach you something. Now, I do understand and agree that there are cases and jobs that require a known public image but I'm not trying to cover those cases, you know what cases I'm covering here. If you are obsessed with the people that follow you on twitter, you are likely just addicted to the dopamine hits it brings.

Caring is more important than being cool
==

We live in a cool era and by that, I mean people are more worried about being cool than actually doing something interesting. We like our dopamine hits but, turns out, it's sometimes better for you to work on the "boring" projects than working on the things that will make you look cool. The "boring" projects many times have more value for other people than the things that actually make you look cool. I've got nothing against people working on "cool" projects, I think it's great and I thank everyone for doing that. But, if this has happened to you, you know that at some point in your life you're going to hit it. 

So, keeping in mind that it is more rewarding to work on things that you care about and that caring about the things you work on is more important than being cool.

Don't sell spaghetti with Italian meatball sauce
==

YOU GOTTA STOP THIS S#@$(!

Speaking of doing things that make us look cool, something that happens very often on social media is that people talk about things they don't know. They pretend they care because they want to look cool. There are many people talking about diversity and inclusivity and very few of them actually know what diversity and inclusivity are.

If you don't know something just do research, google it, learn and then talk about it. Another option is to not talk about it. Being in favor of something is not wrong. Supporting a cause is perfect and you don't need to be an expert on the topic to do so. What's wrong is emitting advice and opinions on things you don't care enough about to actually go and educate yourself on doing so.

Now, the Italian meatball sauce doesn't exist. Do you want to sell it? Fine, go ahead and do it but don't call it Italian, it's not *traditional* Italian sauce.

Don't talk about things you don't care about or things you don't have enough time to invest on because, most of the time, you will do more harm than good. 

if you don't know something but you want to help, that's perfect. Going back to the example of diversity and inclusivity, you can start by googling it and, more importantly, talking to actual experts in the field. Do research on it, learn about it and then go and talk about it.

I won't fight Hawaiian pizza
==

Learn how to choose your fights otherwise you'll soon be overwhelmed and burn out. You can't be part of every conversation out there. This is why I won't fight the Hawaiian pizza.

Do you want to put pineapple on your pizza? Fine, you're wrong but FINE! You shouldn't be doing that but fine, be happy. I decide to be happy and right and let you be happy and wrong. Enjoy your Hawaiian pizza, just don't call it Italian. ;)

With time I learned not only how to pick my fights. There are many things happening out there, there are many things you feel like you want to fight for. There are many things you feel like you have the knowledge and the time to fight for. Turns out that, among all of those things you could jump on, you should also pick and choose because you will likely not have enough time or sanity for all of them.

One of my previous bosses once told me: "Flavio, you are a smart guy but your problem is that you don't know when to shut the fuck up. You want to jump on every fight and you just don't let some of those go". As usual, it took me some time to grasp this concept and I can tell you now that sometimes it is good to let go. Not only it feels great to be more selective about the things you care about and that you want to fight for but it also leaves you with more time in your hands and sanity in your brain.

Growth is a reward
==

Switching topics a bit. As I was growing and learning more about how to best spend my time and how to best interact with people and I learned that dopamine is a thing, I also learned that growth is a reward. 

I learned this when I was trying to change my perspective on the things I was working on. When I switched from doing things to be known to spending time on the things I actually care about, I noticed a drop on my dopamine hits, or rather, I noticed that I would get these hits from somewhere else. I learned that growing is a reward, it makes me feel better and it provides a similar effect. I'm not really talking about the promotions you get at work, those are awesome but not what I'm referring to. What I'm referring to are the little steps you take in your career, in silence. Every time you learn something, every time you read and start a research on a new topic, every time you achieve something, every time you interact with someone in a constructive way.

Every time I felt I was learning something new was enough for me to keep myself motivated and keep doing what I was doing.

You own your own growth
==

Looking deeper into what growth is and trying to find the best way to reason about it taught me that you own your own growth. We are the ones in control of our own growth. I know there are different situations for different people and that we all don't get the same opportunities but, within those opportunities we get, we are responsible for what we do.

I used to have lots of self-pity. Turns out I'm not 100% Italian, I'm an Italian-Venezuelan. I come from a 100% Italian family but I was born and raised in Venezuela. If you know anything about Venezuela today, it's probably that it went from being the richest country in South America to be the poorest one in not so many years. Thing is when I started coding and learning new things I didn't have the same opportunities as others, while some people could just focus on their career I had to worry about food and other basic survival needs. I couldn't go to conferences because of the economy of my country and also, survive was more important.

These things, although true, became my excuse for not pushing myself towards new things. They were my excuse to stay in my comfort zone. I kept using these excuses even after I had moved to Italy and after my economy had changed significantly compared to what it was back in Venezuela. It didn't matter that I had been out of "the thing stopping me" enough, it was just easier to use that excuse and to don't push myself. As soon as I realized this, I started taking new risks in my career. These risks came with failures (lots of failures), lessons and successes.

Let me put it in a different way: It's like being a 40 years old person and claiming I'm orphan. If you are 40 years old you are not an orphan. *Kids* are orphans, let society worry about helping kids. If you are a grown-up, you should take care of yourself and move on. So, I was not an orphan anymore, I was out of Venezuela already and I had to stop using this thing as an excuse.

What I did was finding myself a new job. I'm not suggesting everyone should go out and find themselves a new job, although it worked for me.

Trying is free
==

I learned trying is free when I started seeking a new job. I tried and tried and tried. I tried with Google and failed (remember? Big O?) and quite a few other companies. I learned a lot throughout the process and I was eventually able to choose between the company I'm at now and some other startup. I finally got this job and that gave me the confidence and motivational boost I needed to ramp up.

Trying is free and you can try different things. You can try to get a new job, you can try to get the promotion you want, you can try getting the salary increase you want. Thing is, there are hard things out there but that's not a reason to not push yourself. It's hard and scary sometimes, yes. But, if you don't give things a try, you won't know what it is you need to learn or improve to reach these goals.

I had no idea how compilers worked 'till I started contributing to the Rust compiler. I contributed to it and I loved it. I worked on it for two years and I learned a lot about this part of our industry. Had I not tried, I would have never learned how hard it's to work on a compiler ;)

Find Mentors
==

I had figured out Google, why would I ever need anyone to teach me anything? Right? RIGHT? Oh boy, I was so wrong. I would have saved myself some failures if I would have listened to some people in the early days of my career. This is one of the things that I believe everyone will sooner or later figure out. I wish I would have known this earlier in my career but I'm also thankful it didn't take me that long.

I found myself some mentors. Not one but many because you learn different things from different people. I also learned that you don't really need to go to them and tell them they are your mentors and to please hold your hand throughout the way. You can do that and that is awesome. If you have someone that you look up to go and grant that person some dopamine hits from time to time.However, the important thing is to find people that you share a vision with and that you can learn things from. Look closely at how they interact, learn from them and eventually move on.

Mentors don't have to be for life, you can, and likely should, switch between mentors as you grow and you can go back to previous mentors if you feel like it. The important thing is to have a mentor, to have someone that can provide hints on what it is you need to do to take the next step as you experiment and grow. There is always something to learn and there's always someone that can teach that to you.

It is hard to believe but, Google doesn't have all the answers.

Compete with yourself, collaborate with others
==

I learned to code online and, in my very naive and arrogant view of the world, I thought the only way to succeed was competing with everyone out there. I have to beat them all, I told myself. I'm going to learn everything about computers, even the things I don't really need, so I'll be able to compete with everyone, I thought.

As you may expect, I burned out. Competing with the internet is **exhausting** and **pointless** to say the least. Admittedly, it's also very arrogant. During my recovery process after burning out, I figured that it would be more productive to compete with myself and that's what I did and still do.

I learned how to compete with my fears and started trying new things. I learned how to compete against my own ignorance and started listening to what other people have said and done. I learned to compete against my impatience and started giving things time to mature 'cause not everything can happen now. I learned how to compete against my low self-esteem and I learned how to compete against my self-pity.

if there's anyone you should be competing against in this world is yourself. You should compete against the things that hold you back. Instead of spending so much time trying to be the best on Twitter, you should spend some extra time on trying to be a better person. Compete against yourself and collaborate with other people.

Collaborating with other people actually makes you a better person and helps you with your career. Collaborating helps your growth, which then becomes a reward and that results in more dopamine hits (*wink* *wink*).

Collaborating off-line is also important. When I say collaboration I don't only mean upstream collaboration, I also mean downstream collaboration. Talk to your co-workers, make your company better, make your team better.

Boredom may be a sign
==

I also learned that boredom may be a sign. It may be a sign that something is off in your life.

I get bored very easily, I've always been like this. When I was a kid I had everything. I had consoles, nature, nice neighbors, everything I needed to have fun and yet, I would go to my dad almost every weekend to tell him I was bored. 

As I grew in my career and explored with new projects, I noticed the same thing happened and I thought it was because of the way I am. I learned how to use this as a way to determine whether it is time for me to change projects or not.

After spending some time on some things and especially when I feel I'm getting bored, I take some time to dive in and figure out whether it's just me being silly or whether it's a sign that I'm not learning new things and growing. I look deep to see what exactly I'm bored about. Is it the project? Is it the community? Is the specific task I'm working on? Answering these questions help a great deal with figuring out what my next move should be.

If I'm bored with the task, then it's easy I can find a new task and work on that. If it's the project, however, it might be a sign that a bigger change is needed and that I should probably be looking into what my next thing is. Guess what? that is totally fine because you should be working on the things that you care about. If you don't care enough about the project, the community, or the company then you should probably move on.

Things must feel right
==

I tend to rationalize everything I do and that I'm part of but that's not always enough.

I learned this from working on OpenStack while trying to organize a community of thousands of developers. Sometimes it's better for things to feel right than necessarily being entirely rational and correct. You want to create an environment where people feel safe and comfortable with. You don't want to be in an environment where things are rationally sound but don't feel right. Sometimes you need to trust Mr. Gut.

Having self-confidence is not the same as being arrogant
==

I went from having an extreme amount of self-confidence to none. When I was slapped in the face with the different bad interview experiences and the rest of my learning process I did some introspection on how my bit of arrogant attitude could be helping or not my career.

I went from being arrogant to have no confidence at all to the point I would think everyone would know more than me and that I would never know anything.

Self-confidence is not the same as being arrogant, don't fool yourself either way. I trust my ability to complete things. I trust my ability to learn. I trust my ability to adapt and I also trust my ability to do engineering. I now know that I don't know everything and that there are many things in life that you can learn if you listen. 

All this will help you build up your self-confidence a bit more and it'll make you a better person. What I changed was that I stopped having so much confidence in the things I know and I started to have more confidence in the things that I'm capable of. I know what I'm capable of, I know I don't know everything and that I can learn these things given enough time and dedications.

If you are arrogant you probably don't know it right now but please stop it. Do it for yourself and have some self-confidence, which is different.

Honest self-evaluation is important
==

This is actually what I've always done. It didn't magically hit me. I've always tried to think about the things that I may be doing wrong and how I could fix them, even as a kid. 

I still do this. Every year or every 6 months I would come up with an anonymous google form that has 2 questions: 

# Tell me everything you love about working with me
# Tell me everything you hate about working with me

I send the link to this form to the people I've been working close to in the last period. You gotta be ready because some folks are **extremely** honest. However, if you don't get stuck in the harsher parts of the feedback and you read in-between lines, you'll find things that will help you improve. Reading between line is almost mandatory in this case. Forms are a rational mean of communication and, in this case, you're trying to get a, perhaps, more emotional answer.

Among all the things I do frequently, I think self-evaluation is probably the one I value the most. It keeps me honest and, when in doubt, I know I can reach out to other people that would help with the task, my mentors.

Give emotional answers when needed
==

Asking for feedback from people taught me that it is important to give emotional answers when needed. I've gotten many emails and requests for feedback about things that can't be rationalized. That's when you should pick up the phone (I hate phones) and have a conversation with this other human.

You can't just drop an email to people asking for advice on a thing related to their career. It's their career, it's their life. There is emotion behind questions like: "Tell me how I'm doing" and those deserve having an actual synchronous conversation. Human interaction is important in these, and many other, cases.

Dedicate more time to meaningful relationships
==

I try to build a meaningful relationship in every conference I go. I don't try to meet as many people as possible. What I try to do is to know at least 1 person, well enough. I try to learn what that human works on, what motivates him/her and if I get to learn his/her hobbies then it's even better.

The important thing here is that I'll remember this, I'll remember the human and I can also learn from this person. We all are amazing in our own way.

Your culture is an asset
==

All the ups and downs in my self-confidence, going from not pushing myself to owning my growth, caring about people, etc. taught me that my culture is an asset and I believe this is true for every human out there. 

We all have our own cultures and we should all take the most out of it. Use the positive aspects of it to complement our team, improve our interactions, increase our productivity and get the results we want. There's a lot we can share and teach each other from our cultures.

For example, not everyone solves problems the same way and not every way to solve problems works in every case. Teach me how you solve problems based on your own culture, I'll teach you how I do it and we will likely be able to solve this problem more easily. This is just one example of the power there is behind cultures.

Don't let your passion kill your motivation
==

I actually have an entire talk on this topic but, in a nutshell, your passion can sometimes kill your motivation and take you to burn out.

One of my managers once told me: "Among all your qualities, Flavio, the passion you dedicate and put on the things you work on is the one I like the most. Don't change that". As I'm used to, I started analyzing what this passion was doing for me. I'm dedicating all my passion and energy to all these things that I'm doing. I want to do more, I want to learn more and I also want to have a bigger impact. Am I actually investing my passion properly? Why am I not feeling that I'm being productive enough? Turns out that I was spreading myself too large and that was killing my motivation.

Your passion is awesome, it'll motivate you, it'll drive you to do more things and spread yourself more and more. However, if you are not careful, it can also take you to burn out and demotivation. We all need some rewards on our path regardless how little or big they are.

Do the best with the time you have
==

All these things that I've mentioned so far work well alone but they also relate to each other. I learned, after thinking more about time and how I spend, that investing time in your passion is not about rushing to do more things because you don't have enough time but rather doing the best you can with the time you have. These two are two very different things.

You know you have a limited amount of time you can dedicate to the projects your working on. By knowing this, you have the power to dedicate as much passion and focus as possible to a specific thing to do the best you can with the amount of time you have available. Don't try to rush because you want to do more but rather do less and better with the time you have available.

This kinda translates to not always saying yes, especially if you work on an open source project. If you say yes to all the requests people have you won't be able to do the things the best way possible. Let them know you don't have enough time and rather ask for help.

Don't over-commit
==

The more you over-commit the more likely you'll underdeliver, which will then lead you to demotivation. Not only you will be demotivated because you are underdelivering but you will also let down people that depend on the thing you have committed to.

I have a great deal of respect for the people that let me know when they can't work on something because they have enough things on their plate. These people show respect for the things they do, they show respect for my time and they care about delivering the things they commit to doing. It shows that they don't care about just doing more but rather about doing the best they can with their time.

Unplug
==

Unplug from the things you are doing. It's great to give 150% to the things you do but you should be able to unplug from the things you are doing and get back to them later if you want.

If you are leading an open source project and you feel you can't unplug from it, then you are probably building a community that goes around you, which is not healthy for you or your project.

This is not about holidays, it's not about taking 4 days off. It's about being able to disappear from conferences for a year if you want and then come back. People won't forget you and if they do, that shouldn't be a big problem

Tech is not my life
==

I love tech, I love spending time on tech but it's not my life. I'm extremely passioned about it but it's not what defines me. It's a tool, it's something I spend time on.

I love my relationships beyond tech, I love my hobbies and I love the friends that I have. I'm not what social media says I am. There's a life beyond tech. The time you spend outside tech can actually make you better in tech. Go and learn new things outside your tech environment and bring them in, we have a lot to learn and improve.
