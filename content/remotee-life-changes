'Hey there, I'm a developer and I work remotely.'

That's the answer I give to people mostly every time I get ask 'What do you do for a living?' and usually, the first comment I get back is, 'Wow, that's amazing, how do you do that? I'm not sure I'd be capable of ....'. Now, let me tell you a secret: As far as work's concerned, it's not big deal.

When I first joined Red Hat, I was so exited about the opportunity to work remotely, the trust that had been given to me and the fact that I would be able to move my work with me. It's been 10 months since then and I'm still so freaking exited about it.

Getting things done
===================

Is this something useful for the company I work for? Is this something that could help my team and the project I'm working on? I ask these and many other things, every single day.

Everyday, you'll find yourself struggling with 'task picking', you'll go through existing bugs and jump between real issues and feature requests. You'll also spend a lot of time 'watching emails' - if you know what I mean - wondering how the heck that dude manages to answer emails and still getting things done.

If there's something I've learned from being a remotee, is that what really matters is not just getting things done, it's knowing what things should be done first.

Everyone is capable of getting things done - I believe so - but it gets trickier when you've got to give priorities to those things. This applies in everything you do. For example:

    * If you're a developer and you're focused on a specific area, 90% of the emails you receive, most likely, are useless. Filter them out.

    * Use lazy consensus as much as possible. Assume people agrees if they don't speak up.

    * Don't pick low-hanging-fruits when there are high-hairy-coconuts

    * Don't wait for a miracle, make it happen.


Don't be a hero
===============

You're working remotely, you want people to see you and let them know you're getting things done. Keep that up but don't try to save the world. Remotees have higher probabilities to burnout than people working from offices. You **don't** want to burnout.

Pick an area / topic you want to focus on and stick to that. From time to time, let yourself dig on other things but don't try to get too involved in those. Remember that you've already plenty things to do in your team and if you don't, then make them up.

Make sure you get enough things to keep you busy but let some for other folks that need to do the same. You don't have to save the world yourself, that's what the team is for, right?

Discipline
==========

This is a must. I don't mean you need to have a very strict routine here, although that makes the whole process simple. What I mean by discipline is that you've to teach yourself how to do all the above. Make sure you understand the basic concepts of what working remotely means, read books.

You've to teach yourself not just how to work remotely. You also have to know how to stop working. Take your time, take a break and make sure to take some serious rest.

Teach yourself how to be productive, how to be present for others when they need you. Learn how to improve your work-flow, do it constantly. Try new methodologies, get the one that works best for you and don't hesitate to ask dumb questions. There's not such a thing.

What's changed?
===============

Working remotely gives you as much freedom as it takes away from you. Use your time wisely and be selective on the things you're working on.

A lot of things have changed in the way I work. I had to adopt a whole new way of doing things and getting things done. I've learned a lot so far and I keep doing it every day.

There's one thing that changed for sure, I'm having a lot of fun.
