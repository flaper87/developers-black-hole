FYI:

If you anytime want to install rabbitmq in a machine running iptables, please, remember to ACCEPT everything comming from localhost (at least the ports needed by rabbitmq and erlang).

### To add to the iptables.rules file

-I INPUT -s 127.0.0.1 -p tcp -j ACCEPT 
-I INPUT -s 127.0.0.1 -p udp -j ACCEPT
