Hi Everyone,

Well, MongoUK has ended and I'm now in my room with nothing to do and remembering all those great things I've lived in the las 2 days. I'd like to thank 10gen guys and all the mongodb team, I'd also like to give a special thank to Meghan Gill for her great work organizing MongoUK and contacting us as speakers.

So, What did we do in mongouk??
