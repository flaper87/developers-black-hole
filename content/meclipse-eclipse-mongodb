Hey Everybody,

I've uploaded <a href="http://github.com/FlaPer87/meclipse">Meclipse</a> to github. 

<br />
<h3>What is Meclipse?</h3>

Well, Meclipse is an eclipse plugin for mongodb.

<br />
<h3>What does Meclipse do???</h3>

* It has a MongoDB View that contains a list of servers (connections). It is possible to add/remove connections. They are saved in a settings file.
* It loads (as TreeView) the list of databases and collections.
* It loads the data found in the collection. To do this, Meclipse opens a new Editor and shows the data loaded (This part needs a lot of work).

<br />
<h3>Is it really needed?</h3>

I started it because I use MongoDB, I use eclipse and I don't want to have 100000x10^10 applications opened to do what I need to do so.......

<br />
<h3>What's next?</h3>

* Meclipse already shows the connections, databases, collections and data stored in MongoDB so I think that the critical point (where I/you/we should focus ) is how data is shown in the editor.
* Many other things.

I hope you like it and find it useful, and please, feel free to fork, do pull request and everything needed to improve Meclipse.
