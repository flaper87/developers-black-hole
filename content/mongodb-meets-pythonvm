A week or 2 ago I pushed on github a new project I'm working on (as usual in my free time).

It is a PythonVM implementation for mongodb which allow users to run python code inside mongodb. I wouldn't suggest to use it as main scripting engine (this would also require a big change inside mongodb so just forget it) but It would be nice to be able to use it for map/reduce operations and better language integration (at least for the python lovers out there).

Even if it might not be THAT useful it is still fun and it is mongodb so...

Feel free tu clone / hack and pull request
