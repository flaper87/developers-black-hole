Hey Everyone,

Just wanted to make a post explaining how wonderful the last week was. Thanks to the GNOME Foundation it was possible for me to be present at the 25th CSUN Conference and share with a group of amazing guys awesome experiences, ideas and dinners =)

One of the things that made the last week that awesome is that I finally met some of the other gnome-a11y guys: Willie Walker, Joanmarie Diggs, Ben Konrath, Mike Gorse, Brad Taylor, Bryen Yunashko, Steve Lee, Li Yuan, Ke Wang, Alejandro Pi√±eiro, Peter Korn y Eitan Isaacson (good job organizing the Hackfest). 

I'll try to shortly describe what we did:

* On Monday wew met at the lobby and saw our faces for the first time, after that we had lunch and then Bryen and I started our little planet-a11y hackfest. Good Job Bryen!!!

* On Tuesday we had a hackfest at the Ford A and B room. What a wonderful meeting, We talked about what we should do from now on and how things are going to be. We discussed about GNOME3 a11y and we also reviewed each of the topics found <a href="http://live.gnome.org/Accessibility/GNOME3">here</a>. After dinner (or before, I don't remember anymore XD) We gave to Will a present for his 20th years of hard work on a11y this was planned by (Peter Korn), it was nice and really exciting.

* On Wednesday, Thursday, Friday and Saturday we all did booth duties =D Many people came by and many of them were really exited about how GNOME-A11Y works. We had demos of Orca, Caribou, MouseTrap and people really liked GNOME-a11y apps.

Well that's it. As I said, I shortly described what we did the last week but it doesn't mean that it was that short XD It was a loooong and exciting week. And guess what, We are already thinking about next CSUN, WOOOOOOOTTTT!!!!!
