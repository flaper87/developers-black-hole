Technology is social before it's technical - Gilles Deleuze

Humans are driven quite a bit by emotions. You may be a rational human being but
your emotions will still drive many of your choices. You can be excited, angry,
interested, or sad about things. It doesn't matter, you'll react to those
emotions and you'll very often leak that into your communications.

You'll likely leak your emotions and so will other members of the community. If
you think humans should suck it up and act like nothing is happening, I'm afraid
you are living in a bubble. That is not how humans operate. That's not how
humans interact.

Some humans know this and these humans should make sure other humans know this
as well. Emotions matter and they affect our daily tasks. Emotions take control
over many times during our day and they determine how our day will go. Being
thick skinned doesn't really matter. It just means you can control your emotions
a bit more than others but you still react to them. You react in a different,
perhaps more controlled, way but you still react to your emotions.

There's nothing wrong about this, though. It's one of the things that makes us
humans. Emotions are fine, we just need to learn how to deal with them and how
they may or may not affect our days. We need to learn how to be smart about our
emotions and we need to learn how to react to each one of our emotions. We need
to be observant of ourselves and others

I don't think we should turn communities into therapy sessions. But I do think
we should learn how to communicate in a open and friendly way. We can be smarter
in our interactions with other members of the community. If we're all observant
of our emotions, we'll be able to act properly whenever things are not going
exactly well.

I try to keep a low profile whenever my days are not going exactly well. I do
this because I don't want other people to be affected by this. This doesn't mean
I don't talk to other members. Keeping a low profile in the community doesn't
mean you should hide your emotions from everyone. To me, it means I just don't
engage as much on discussions that require my entire focus.

On the other hand, if you notice someone is having a bad day you can choose to
either reach out or to not make their day worse. You should care, your community
is made by humans not laptops.

So, assume good faith or better, always communicate in a friendly way regardless
of what your current emotions are or what other member's current emotions are.
Don't loose it and focus on what really matters. I know this is all easier said
than done but hey, I'm on the same boat.
